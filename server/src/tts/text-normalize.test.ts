/* Unit coverage for the TTS-bound text normalizer.

   Each case here is anchored to a concrete failure mode we saw end-to-end
   with XTTS v2: chapter openers spelled as letters, em-dash repetition
   loops, and the cumulative ~60s of garbled audio at the top of chapter 2.
   The composed `normaliseForTts` is the single entry point used by
   `synthesiseChapter`; the named exports are tested individually so a
   future refactor that splits or reorders the transforms can pin which
   half regressed. */
