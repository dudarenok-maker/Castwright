<!--
Draft release notes for the NEXT version (technical register — this IS the
GitHub release body). bump-version.mjs feeds this file verbatim as the
annotated-tag message → release.yml, and now uses it by DEFAULT (no
--notes-file needed). Everything in this HTML comment is invisible in the
rendered release, so it never leaks into the body.

Keep it current for each release:
  1. Update the version marker below.
  2. Rewrite the body (theme paragraph → ## ✨ Headline features with
     ### … (new) subsections → emoji-themed sections → bold-lead bullets with
     (#PR) refs → **Full changelog:** vPREV...vNEW footer). v1.7.0 is the
     canonical example; see CONTRIBUTING.md "Release notes".

The marker is what bump-version checks: if it doesn't match the version being
cut, the bump refuses (so a stale file can't ship as the body). The
user-facing, brand-voice notes live separately in RELEASE_NOTES.md (#/release-notes).

release-notes-next-version: 1.15.0

Cycle opened 2026-07-24 (v1.14.0 shipped 2026-07-23; first PR of the new
cycle reopens this file per CONTRIBUTING.md "Release notes"). Populated
PR-by-PR as the v1.15.0 cycle progresses — do not reconstruct from git
history at cut time.

## 📝 Script review & manuscript

- Detect emotions can now be scoped to the current chapter — the header button runs the emotion + reaction passes on just the chapter you're viewing, with whole-book still available from its ⌄ menu. (fs-35, #592)

## 🎧 Listening & revising

- **fs-10 — chapter-title segment on the Listen timeline** (#412). `ChapterAudio.segments[]`
  gains an optional `kind: 'title'` discriminator and the chapter-audio route stops filtering the
  synthetic title beat out of both `/audio` and `/audio/previous`. The mini-player scrubber paints
  it as a non-interactive labelled band; the Generation view's "Narrative order" strip fills it
  neutrally rather than in the narrator's colour. **Also fixes a latent off-by-one:** because the
  published array was short one leading row, `resolveSegmentForSec`'s index no longer matched the
  on-disk index the splice route addresses, so Listen-view "Fix this line" targeted the line before
  the marked one.

## 📱 Companion app

- **Demo library covers for _Saltgrave_ and _The Tidewatcher's Oath_ were swapped** (#1792). The
  committed `apps/android/assets/demo-covers/hollow-tide-2.png` (mapped to _The Tidewatcher's Oath_
  in `demo_data.dart`) held the _Saltgrave_ artwork and vice versa — the filenames were correct, so
  the filename-mapping test could not see it. Swapped both the committed downscaled assets and the
  git-ignored `brand/book-covers/` sources (so regeneration stays correct), and added a SHA-256
  regression guard in `scripts/tests/build-demo-covers.test.mjs` that pins the corrected art.

## 📖 Help

- **Mirror the marketing site's local-first privacy FAQ into the app Help view** (#1793). Adds two
  Help topics — `is-my-data-private` (files) and `does-it-work-offline` (analysis) — to
  `src/data/help-topics.ts`, matching the website's corrected copy: analysis is local by default and
  the cloud fallback is opt-out (on by default, switchable off), never framed as opt-in-only or
  "never touches the cloud". Guarded by `src/data/help-topics.test.ts`; item-count assertions bumped
  43 → 45.
