# Bulk-apply library sync on confirm-cast

> Status: draft
> Key files: `src/views/confirm-cast.tsx`, new `src/views/confirm-cast.test.tsx`, new `e2e/bulk-sync-library.spec.ts`
> URL surface: `#/books/<id>/confirm` (no router grammar change)
> OpenAPI ops: none (purely a UI compression over existing `POST /api/library-cast/override`)

## Benefit / Rationale

- **User:** large manuscripts in long-running series carry many characters that were already cast in prior books (12+ for Keeper-of-the-Lost-Cities-scale projects). Today the "Continuity preserved" footer's "Sync profile" checkbox is opt-in per-character and defaults off, so the user clicks once per card before clicking "Confirm cast." A "Sync N profiles from library" pill at the top of the view compresses N clicks to 1, with per-card untick still available for the rare exception (e.g. a character has grown up between books and the analyzer's fresher description is wanted instead of the library record). Manual link-prior (plan 09 §"Manual continuity link", shipped 2026-05-17) still handles the inverse case where the auto-matcher missed.
- **Technical:** purely additive on the existing batch path. `handleConfirm` in `src/views/confirm-cast.tsx:62-86` already iterates characters, gates on `decisions[c.id] === 'match' && overrides[c.id] && target?.bookId`, and fires each opted-in override through `POST /api/library-cast/override` via `Promise.allSettled`. The pill needs only to call `setOverrides` once with an object spread covering every eligible character; the existing batch fires unchanged on "Confirm cast". No new endpoint, no new Redux action, no new mocks.
- **Architectural:** completes the plan 09 §94 "Bulk-accept-all UI" item that was explicitly deferred to a v1 follow-up. Closes a v1 ergonomics gap without re-opening any of plan 09's matcher-side invariants (score floors, candidate ordering, alias dedup).

## Architectural impact

- **New seams:** none — the work is one component-local handler + one new visual element in `src/views/confirm-cast.tsx`.
- **Invariants preserved:**
  - Plan 09 invariant: `overrides` defaults off per character; the bulk pill is an explicit user action, not an automatic ticker. The destructive override (analyzer description → library description) still requires deliberate user assent (one click for the cast vs. N clicks today).
  - Plan 26 (RTK Immer drafts): N/A — `overrides` is local React state (`useState`), not a slice; the pill writes via `setOverrides`, not via a reducer.
  - Plan 25 (Design tokens): the new pill uses existing tokens (`--peach`, `--ink`, etc.) via the `PrimaryButton` / `Pill` primitives in `src/components/primitives.tsx`. No hex literals.
- **Migration story:** none. No persisted state changes; `state.json` / `cast.json` shape is untouched. The library-cast-override calls fire through the same endpoint and write the same fields as today.
- **Reversibility:** trivial. Removing the pill (one block of JSX + one handler) reverts to per-character clicking. No data shape to roll back.

## Invariants to preserve

1. The pill appears **only** when at least one character has `c.matchedFrom?.bookId && c.matchedFrom?.characterId` (the same predicate `confirm-cast.tsx:117-121` uses for `canOverrideLibrary`). When zero characters are eligible, the pill is hidden entirely.
2. The pill toggles **only eligible characters**. Characters whose `decision[c.id] !== 'match'` (user declined the auto-match) are not affected; the bulk action is "sync everyone the matcher matched," not "match everyone."
3. The pill text reflects the **target state**, not the current state: "Sync N profiles from library" until every eligible character is ticked, then "Clear all syncs". `N` is the count of eligible characters (constant), not the count of currently-unticked ones — so the user sees the scope of the bulk action up-front.
4. Per-character toggles continue to work after a bulk tick — the user can untick exceptions before clicking "Confirm cast", and the pill text immediately reflects the new state (back to "Sync 1 profile from library" if one exception was unticked).
5. Existing `handleConfirm` batch in `confirm-cast.tsx:62-86` is the only path to `POST /api/library-cast/override`. The pill does NOT fire requests directly — it only updates local state. This keeps "Confirm cast" as the single commit point.

## Test plan

### Automated coverage

- **Vitest unit (`src/views/confirm-cast.test.tsx`)** — new spec (verify if file exists; if not, create alongside the view). Cases:
  - Render with 3 matched + 2 unmatched characters → pill renders with text "Sync 3 profiles from library".
  - Click pill → every matched character's checkbox is ticked; unmatched ones unchanged.
  - Click pill again → every checkbox cleared.
  - Untick one matched character's checkbox manually after a bulk tick → pill text flips to "Sync 1 profile from library".
  - Render with 0 matched characters → pill is absent from the DOM.
- **Playwright e2e (`e2e/bulk-sync-library.spec.ts`)** — new spec mirroring `e2e/manual-continuity-link.spec.ts` structure. Cold-boot → paste fixture → analysing → confirm. Assert pill renders, click it, assert all matched characters' "Sync profile" checkboxes are ticked. Click "Confirm cast and review manuscript", assert library-cast-override responses come back (network log or resulting Redux updates). Mock-mode only.
- If `src/mocks/canned-data.ts` only seeds one pre-matched character today (ANALYSIS_NORTHERN_STAR), extend the fixture to seed two more so the bulk button's count is meaningful in tests — currently Halloran is the only one with `matchedFrom` set on the canned response.

### Manual acceptance walkthrough

Run in mock mode (`npm run dev` + `VITE_USE_MOCKS=true`).

1. **Cold boot at `#/`** → library cards visible.
2. **Click "Start a new book"** → `#/new`, upload modal opens.
3. **Paste a tiny manuscript + confirm metadata** → land at `#/books/<id>/analysing`. Click "Start analysis" → wait for the four mock phases.
4. **Land at `#/books/<id>/confirm`** → cast cards render. **Expected:** pill appears above the card grid, text "Sync N profiles from library" where N matches the number of cards showing "Continuity preserved" footers.
5. **Click pill** → every "Sync profile" checkbox below ticks; pill text flips to "Clear all syncs".
6. **Untick one character's checkbox manually** → pill text flips back to "Sync 1 profile from library".
7. **Click pill again** → the unticked checkbox re-ticks; pill text returns to "Clear all syncs".
8. **Click "Confirm cast and review manuscript"** → library-cast-override responses fire for every ticked character; the view transitions to the ready stage.
9. **Cold-boot a book whose analyser fixture has zero `matchedFrom` characters** → confirm pill is absent.

## Out of scope

- Defaulting per-character "Sync profile" checkbox to on. Considered and rejected — discoverability of an explicit pill beats a hidden default flip, and the override silently overwrites analyzer-generated descriptions.
- Score-floor filtering on the bulk. The matcher's `voice-match.ts::scoreOne` floor already gates which characters carry `matchedFrom`; adding a second threshold in the UI would silently exclude legitimate matches.
- Server-side batch endpoint. The existing per-character POST loop in `handleConfirm` is fast enough at N=20 (~1s wall-clock total) and the request fan-out simplifies error reporting per character. A batch endpoint would be premature optimisation.
- Persisting bulk-tick state across sessions. `overrides` is intentionally local (`useState`); confirm-cast is a one-shot view, not a returning surface.
