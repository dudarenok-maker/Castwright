## Benefit / Rationale

A user watching a long book render had no way to see how fast it was going. The
slow per-sample voice-audition path (`/synthesize`, RTF ~8 on this box) logs a
per-call `rtf=`, but the FAST batched chapter path (`/synthesize-batch`, the one
that actually does generation, target RTF ~1) logged **nothing** — so the only
RTF in the log was misleadingly slow, and a long in-progress chapter (audio is
written only at chapter completion) looked stalled when it was fine.

- **User:** can self-monitor generation speed without grepping logs. The
  top-bar Admin pill shows a **live per-batch RTF** that moves every ~batch
  (updated as each Qwen batch lands) — the figure you can actually act on
  mid-chapter — falling back to the per-chapter rolling figure when no batch is
  recent. The server log also prints a per-chapter rollup (`rtf`, `Nx realtime`,
  `chapters/hr`) as a lagging summary. Clicking the pill opens the Admin watch
  console ([[171-admin-watch-console]]), which also renders a **per-chapter throughput table** (newest-first
  RTF history with a ▲/▼ deterioration cue + a run-summary strip) so the operator
  can see whether RTF is deteriorating or staying consistent across a run — the
  same answer that previously required grepping the `[generation] chapter N …
  rtf=` log lines.
- **Technical:** the batched forward now emits `qwen batch synth: … rtf=` AND
  reports its `genMs`/`audioMs` in the `/synthesize-batch` frame header, so the
  server can surface a live per-batch RTF — observable and comparable to the
  single-call line.
- **Architectural:** a single module-level throughput accumulator
  (`generation-stats.ts`) is the one source of truth, surfaced over one tiny GET
  endpoint; no new SSE event-type churn, no per-book plumbing.

## Architectural impact

- **New seams:** `recordChapterThroughput` / `getGenerationStats` in
  `server/src/tts/generation-stats.ts` (rolling window, resets after a 10-min
  idle gap so a stale run never dilutes the current one); `GET
  /api/generation/stats`; `api.getGenerationStats()` (real + mock); the
  `WorktreesRtfPill` component.
- **Per-chapter history ring (newest-first, capped at `MAX_HISTORY` = 200):** a
  third in-memory list in `generation-stats.ts`, populated by
  `recordChapterThroughput` with each finished chapter's own `{ rtf, audioSec,
  synthSec, title, bookId, modelKey, at }`. Surfaced as
  `GenerationStatsResponse.recentChapters` and rendered by the
  `GenerationThroughput` table in `src/views/worktrees.tsx`. In-memory only:
  survives a sidecar recycle (the Node process persists; only the Python sidecar
  restarts per-batch), resets on a full server restart.
- **Invariants preserved:** mock/real api split (mock returns the idle shape);
  the RTF readout keeps its `data-testid="topbar-rtf"` and the live/per-chapter
  fallback behaviour. Since [[171-admin-watch-console]] the pill is the all-users
  `AdminPill` (always rendered; testid `topbar-admin-link`, click → `#/admin`),
  not the old dev-gated `wt` pill. The sidecar batch path's audio output is
  byte-identical — only a log line was added.
- **RTF convention:** `synth-wall ÷ audio` everywhere (< 1 = faster than
  realtime), matching the existing sidecar single-call line and `bench-tts.py`.
  The sidecar `batch synth` line is pure-compute (`gen_ms ÷ Σ audio_ms`); the
  server rollup + pill are end-to-end (chapter synth wall ÷ audio), which is
  higher because it includes HTTP + queueing + cross-engine waits — by design.
- **Reversibility:** delete the endpoint mount + the pill swap; the accumulator
  is inert if nothing calls `recordChapterThroughput`.

## Invariants to preserve

- `AdminPill` is the ONLY renderer of the RTF readout; it must keep
  `data-testid="topbar-rtf"` for the RTF span and fire `onClick` (→ `#/admin`) so
  existing top-bar coverage and e2e stay green (`src/components/admin-pill.tsx`).
- The sidecar batch line uses the same `rtf=` token as the single line
  (`server/tts-sidecar/main.py`), so a grep for `rtf=` catches both; `batch
  synth` vs `synth` is the only distinguisher.
- `getGenerationStats()` returns the all-null idle shape when no chapter is in
  the rolling window (`server/src/tts/generation-stats.ts`) — the pill relies on
  `rtf === null` to render just "wt".
- The chapter window and the live-batch window are INDEPENDENT: batch fields
  (`liveBatchRtf` etc.) report while the first chapter is still rendering (chapter
  window still empty), and idle on their own `BATCH_IDLE_MS` (5 min) — so a
  chapter-window reset can't blank a live batch readout, and vice versa
  (`server/src/tts/generation-stats.ts`).
- `genMs`/`audioMs` are ADDITIVE frame-header keys; an older sidecar that omits
  them leaves `out.genMs` undefined and `synthBatch` simply skips
  `onBatchComplete` (`server/src/tts/sidecar.ts`, `synthesise-chapter.ts`).
- `recentChapters` is **newest-first**, capped at `MAX_HISTORY`, and **independent
  of the `RESET_MS` rolling-window reset** — an idle gap blanks the aggregate
  (`chapters`/`rtf` → null) but must NOT blank the history (its whole value is the
  cross-pause trend the throughput table draws). The view's deterioration cue
  relies on `recentChapters[0]` being newest and compares each row to the
  immediately-older entry (`server/src/tts/generation-stats.ts`,
  `src/views/worktrees.tsx`).
- The new `recordChapterThroughput` fields (`title`/`bookId`/`modelKey`) are
  OPTIONAL and default to `null` — a bare three-field call still records — so the
  history ring stays back-compatible with existing call sites and tests.
- Each history `rtf` is `null` (not `0`) when the chapter produced no audio, so
  the table renders a dash and skips the trend comparison (no `Infinity` row).

## Test plan

### Automated coverage

- Pytest sidecar (`server/tts-sidecar/tests/test_batch_synthesis.py::test_synthesize_batch_logs_aggregate_rtf`)
  — asserts `synthesize_batch` emits exactly one `qwen batch synth: items=… voices=… text_len=… … rtf=…` line with the right item/voice/text-length counts and a parseable rtf.
- Pytest sidecar (`…::test_route_header_carries_batch_perf`) — the
  `/synthesize-batch` frame header carries `genMs`/`audioMs` (additive to
  `sampleRate`/`lengths`).
- Vitest server (`server/src/tts/generation-stats.test.ts`) — per-chapter rolling
  maths + window reset + idle shape, AND the live-batch window (single-batch rtf,
  multi-batch aggregate + latest, idle past `BATCH_IDLE_MS`, independence from the
  chapter window), AND the per-chapter history ring (records every field
  newest-first, caps at `MAX_HISTORY` keeping the most recent, **survives the
  rolling-window idle reset**, `rtf=null` on no-audio, back-compat 3-field call,
  cleared by the reset helper).
- Vitest server (`server/src/tts/synthesise-chapter.test.ts`) — `onBatchComplete`
  fires once per batch with the sidecar's `genMs`/`audioMs`, and does NOT fire
  when the sidecar omits them.
- Vitest server (`server/src/routes/generation-stats.test.ts`) — `GET
  /api/generation/stats` returns the idle shape, reflects a recorded chapter, and
  serialises the per-chapter history with `title`/`bookId`/`modelKey`.
- Vitest frontend (`src/components/worktrees-rtf-pill.test.tsx`) — idle shows
  just "wt"; generating shows the live per-batch RTF; the live per-batch figure
  is preferred over the per-chapter rollup; falls back to per-chapter when no
  batch is recent; click still navigates; fetch failure degrades to no readout.
- Vitest frontend (`src/views/worktrees.test.tsx`) — the throughput table renders
  one row per chapter newest-first; a slower-than-previous chapter is tinted ▲ and
  a faster one ▼ (oldest row, with nothing to compare, has no glyph); a null-rtf
  row renders a dash with no trend; the empty-state copy shows when no chapters
  are recorded; the run-summary strip appears only when a summary figure is set.

Not adding an e2e spec: the pill and the Worktrees view are dev-only and the
readouts are polled numbers, not a router/redux/layout seam — unit coverage is
the right bar here. The mock `getGenerationStats` now ships a synthetic
rising-rtf history so any e2e visiting the dev view exercises the table without
crashing.

### Manual acceptance walkthrough

1. **Real backend, generation running** → `tail -f logs/server*.log` shows, per
   finished chapter: `[generation] chapter N "<title>" rendered: lines=… groups=…
   audio=…s synth=…s rtf=… (…x realtime); run: … ch, rtf=…, … ch/hr`.
2. **`tail -f logs/tts.err.log`** during a batched chapter → `qwen batch synth:
   items=8 voices=… … rtf=…` lines (the ~1 target), distinct from the slow
   `qwen synth:` audition lines.
3. **Frontend, top bar** → while a book renders, the Admin pill shows
   `Admin 1.1` (the LIVE per-batch RTF, magenta) updating every ~batch; once a
   chapter completes and no batch is mid-flight it shows the per-chapter figure;
   idle → just `Admin` + the health dot. Clicking opens the Admin watch console.
4. **Admin view, during/after a run** → in the **Generation throughput**
   section, the table fills newest-first as each chapter completes;
   its RTF column matches the `[generation] chapter N … rtf=` log lines, a
   chapter that ran slower than the one before shows a ▲ (rose), faster shows ▼
   (green); the run-summary strip mirrors the pill's figures. The history
   persists across a sidecar recycle and clears on a full server restart.

## Out of scope

- Per-sentence RTF (single-call `/synthesize` groups, e.g. a Kokoro narrator)
  feeding the live window — only Qwen batches report `genMs`/`audioMs` today;
  single calls log their own `rtf=` but don't drive the pill.
- The bouncing chapter progress counter (active-line pointer vs completed count)
  — owned by a separate change.
