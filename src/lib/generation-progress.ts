/* Pure helpers for the Generate view's overall-progress bar and the
   per-chapter character meta. Lives outside the React component so the
   weighting math is easy to unit-test without mounting jsdom.

   Why this needs to exist: Done chapters hydrated from disk don't carry a
   `totalLines` value (the SSE never fired in this session), so the naive
   sentence-weighted average drops them to zero and collapses the bar to
   just the in-flight chapter's progress — the 3/7-done-but-shows-4 % bug.
   We weight by sentences-per-chapter from the manuscript when available,
   falling back to the live tick's `totalLines`, then to the average of
   what we do know, then to 1 (equal-weight). */

   tells us who is *currently* speaking, not how many of each character's
   lines have already been synthesised. By line 13 of an 82-line chapter,
   four characters had each spoken at least once, the slice had flipped
   three of them to `done`, and the expanded row showed three full-green
   "Done" bars while 80 % of the chapter was still ahead — the lie behind
   the screenshot bug. With these positions the view can derive the real
   "lines synthesised for this character so far" from `chapter.currentLine`. */

/** Per-character row completion for the Generate view's expanded chapter card.

   The slice's per-character `status` field is NOT a reliable completion
   signal during an in-progress chapter: a regenerate re-streams a chapter
   whose audio still exists on disk, so `hydrateFromBookState` can re-seed
   every cast member as `'done'`, and `applyGenerationTick` only un-`'done'`s
   the *currently speaking* character. Trusting `status === 'done'` therefore
   left previously-rendered speakers pinned at a full-green "Done" bar until
   their first line of the new run — the regenerate stale-Done bug.

   Real completion derives from `chapter.currentLine` + the character's
   manuscript line positions. We only honor the slice when the WHOLE chapter
   is finished (`chapterState === 'done'`, which `chapter_complete` sets atomically
   with every character's `'done'`); otherwise we count lines behind the playhead.
   `linesDoneAt` returns 0 for `currentLine <= 0`, so a fresh/just-regenerated
   run reads as zero for everyone. */
